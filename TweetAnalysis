%% Michael Labarge and Stephanie Roberts CSCI 1320-105 107869863 Zagrodski Final Project
%Purpose: Analyze twitter data along several metrics such as visualizing
%where users are, where they are most popular, and whether people are fond
%or not of cats and dogs.

%% Task One
% CLEAN THE DATA
% Remove all tweets outside of continental USA including Hawaii and Alaska
% by using the country of origin to remove foreign tweets and using the
% city, state pair to remove tweets from Hawaii and Alaska
% Display how many tweets remain in the dataset.


fprintf('There are %d tweets remaining, all from the Continental US,\n all using the English language.',tweetcount)


%% Task Two 
%Plot tweets on a map of the USA and represent them as red dots. Use
%Latitude and Longitude to plot them.
% Use 'Twitter_visualization_help.m to map the dots.
% Use plotm() with the coordinates of the tweets to plot all of them on the map


%% Task Three
%divide the tweets into 48 groups, one for each state
% Label the states by their postal codes and attach the number of followers to the height of the
% bar in the histogram created to compare twitter usage across states
% Save the histogram as a .jpg file and submit this file.


%% Task Four
% Track a statistic of my choice (AVG # of followers per state) 
% Sum all the followers in each state then divide by # of users
% Display these numbers on the map as text numbers on each state using plotm.



%% Task Nine
% Create an interactive map which has latitude, longitude, and height(number of followers)
% create a function 'Terrestrial.m' that sets the number of followers equal to the altitude of the point
% and convert the files into .kml files with these three pieces of information. 
% use 'kmlwritepoint'


%% Task 5
%Total number of tweets per state
%save the maximum number of tweets as myMax using max function 
%save the minimum number of tweets as myMin using min function 
%subtract myMin from each of the states number of tweets, then divide by myMax-myMin
%use map.mat,state_mask, state_names and usa_image to show the results via color difference
%based on result per state

%% Task 6 
%find the most common hashtage for every state
%display the hashtage over that state
%save image as a .jpg

%% Task 7 
% find user with the highest number of followers in each state (if more than one have the same # 
%put (#) after the user that comes first alphabetically  (the # being how many others there are)
%Display the user using @ over the their respective states and save a s a jpg. 

%% Task 8 
%Using the results of task 5, divide the normalized date per state by the number of frames
%add the result each from, causing the color to increase 
%use function cat to make the 4th dimension and use immovie to display the animation

%%Task 10
% Use a sentiment dictionary (provided) to read strings and discern the sentiment of the tweet.
% each word has a sentiment value between [-1,1] and adds its value to the sentence.
% finds each persons sentiment towards cats or dogs and plots them on the map in red for people who like cats,
%green for people who dont like cats, blue for poeple who like dogs and orange for poeple who dont like dogs.
